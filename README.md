#Flappy Tetris
My entry for the [GameOff 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018).

The idea is to make an _hybrid_ between flappy bird and tetris.

1. Install the JDK
2. Install Boot: http://boot-clj.com/
3. In your terminal, go to this directory and enter `boot run`
4. To edit the app in Nightlight, go to http://localhost:4000
